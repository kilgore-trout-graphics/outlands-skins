## Custom Outlands Interface Design Services

### Kilgore Trout's UO Outlands graphics portfolio is available at https://kilgoretroutlands.com.

Here are some free replacement graphics for your container gumps in Ultima Online Outlands. The graphics packs includes the following:

* Paperdoll (yours)
* Paperdoll (others
* Common containers
* Trade gump
* Quantity Slider
* Logout Gump
* New blue menu gem buttons
* New silver menu gem buttons

### Installation

1. In your browser, click on the ZIP file for the skin you want to download.
2. All the way on the right side of the screen, click the button with three dots and select "Download".
1. Go to your Ultima Online Outlands folder (mine's at "c:\Program Files (x86)\Ultima Online Outlands").
2. Make a new folder called gumpoverrides (you may already have one).
3. Unzip the file you downloaded, and put all of the images in the gumpoverrides folder.
4. Close your client and re-start from the launcher.

### Things Worth Knowing

* If you already have a gumpoverrides folder, you may have bmp files that use the same names with different extensions (e.g. myfile.png AND myfile.bmp). This will crash your client since it won't know which file to display. Delete the .bmp version of any duplicated names and you're good to go. I'm happy to help you sort it out too if you run into issues.

* Delete the files from GumpOverrides if you want to restore the original bag graphics.

* These work better when you have hued containers off (Options > Interface > Match Container Gump Hue Mode: Off).

* If you have any questions contact Kilgore Trout on the UO Outlands discord.
